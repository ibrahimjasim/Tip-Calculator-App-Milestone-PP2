## UX
### Site's purpose - key project goals and target audience
This site was developed in order to help a pair/ group of people split a bill after a tip was added to the total amount.
Although most people do know the fundamentals of mathmatics, few can calculate percentages, with or without the use of a calculator.
Tipping culture is a world wide phenomenon in which it is customary for a dining party to add a certain amount on top of the bill to reward quality service.
This practice has become more common even in countries where minimal wage provides a good living standard, thus increasing the demand for a simple calculator that can split the bill after a certain tip was calculated into the total amount.
The target audience are those who live in areas where tipping is customary or is becoming increasingly so.
Using Tip Calculator after a few drinks at the pub with the collegues is a great example of how even those who are usually great at solving complex equations in their heads sometimes need a little help too.



## Design

### Wireframes:
![pp2 bals](https://github.com/ibrahimjasim/Tip-Calculator-App-pp2-/assets/127301769/f88724e6-25f2-4145-a070-8e3fc9e04600)


### Colour scheme:
![extended_color_scheme_with_hex_codes](https://github.com/ibrahimjasim/Tip-Calculator-App-Milestone-PP2/assets/127301769/7369c8ff-9e70-4d5b-bad3-7b26efe17452)
The colour scheme was based on harmony dominating the background by using analogous colours, peach and light pink. 
To keep the background smooth as well as adding depth, a soft gradient was used as to not overwhelm the user.
In order to make the calculator pop out, a contrasting colour was used: blue.
This scheme allowes for the user to experience a simplistic, vibrant yet trustworthy platform that also feels positive thanks to the warmth, harmmony and balance of the colours. 
The text was written in contrasting colours so that the user can comprehend what is expected to be entered into each field even poorly lit areas. 

## Features
### Enter an amount:
![Home 2024-01-09 21_24_31](https://github.com/ibrahimjasim/Tip-Calculator-App-Milestone-PP2/assets/127301769/c12bccb4-c194-42ec-a01e-3c208d037765)
This is straightforward as it allows for the user to understand that this calculator can be used for a variety of tip/percentage based calculations.
The place holder is a simple $-sign as this is a universal symbol for "money", even in countries that use different currencies.

### Tip:
![tip%2024-01-09 21_24_31](https://github.com/ibrahimjasim/Tip-Calculator-App-Milestone-PP2/assets/127301769/d8fe9c5e-9083-40b2-a5fc-99e16dda4423)
To keep the platform user friendly, a simple sliding-action is required by the user in order to select the desired percentage to tip/ add to the billed amount. 
It only allows for whole numbers from 1-100% as to keep the simplicity and user friendlines to a wide audience range. 

### Split:
![spilt2024-01-09 21_24_31](https://github.com/ibrahimjasim/Tip-Calculator-App-Milestone-PP2/assets/127301769/a6a57936-19b9-403c-b4e2-2c6f356cdfbf)
Just as with the Tip, this field requires the user to slide the cursor to the total amount of people that desire to share the bill.
The limit is set to 20, as to keep true to the purpose of the tip calculator: a way to simply divide the bill amongst a group of people.
Although 21 and over are technically also "a group", there must be a limit set and 20 seems like the resonable dividingg line for a simple calculator.

### Results:
![result2024-01-09 21_24_31](https://github.com/ibrahimjasim/Tip-Calculator-App-Milestone-PP2/assets/127301769/d44b0a25-eb2a-44dc-bc77-164fee58b946)
A simple table displaying all nessesary information and output for the useer to both follow, comprehend and share with a relevant audience.
It firstly displays the total tip and tip alone, also using the $-sign to symbolise money.
The second row displays the total bill, tip calculated into the total cost of the exxperience.
The third and last row is the most visually visible one thus it was selected to show the useer the goal of the calculator: the amount due to the individual person in the group. 

### Reset button: 
![rest2024-01-09 21_24_31](https://github.com/ibrahimjasim/Tip-Calculator-App-Milestone-PP2/assets/127301769/5eab5739-878b-44a2-a89c-fb993b46f275)
A simple way to empty the fields and start over. This allows for user friendlieness as it cuts out the required action of unessesary emptying each individual field. 
It was placed at the bottom as to lessen the chance of it being accidentally presseed as each field is filled in.
The red colour is a universal colour that warns the user not to be too eager to press the button without first reading its purpose.

### Dark mode:
This is also to keep true to the purpose of the calculator: to be used at restaurants that are usually dimmed, pubs that are dark and other situations that may encourage the user to protect their vision from the vivid and colourful platform.

### Mobile screen:
The mobile based web page is a miniature version of the computer based page. It has the exact functions, such as slider for entering tip in % and number of people to split the bill, and the same colouring scheme.
It also has the day/night-function. It can do everything the webpage can do in terms of functions, input and output.

## Testing
Since a calculator is supped to calculate, I input values that are easy to double check.
For example, a $100 + 10% tip = $110 total. $110 divided between 2 people = $55. This worked out right.

I also used dark mode and an extremely large number (100000000000000000000000000000000000000) as to test the near maximum of each field (100% tip and split between 20 persons), and it still worked without any error.

I confirmed that the website works in defrent browsers: Chrom, Firefox

I confirmed that the colors and fonts are easy to read and accessible by runnig it through lighthouse in devtools

### Bugs
- [x] your UI comes off the page below 460px. 
- [x] your app breaks under the condition that if you adjust the tip/split prior to entering a number, then when you enter a number no 
  calculation is formed until you adjust the tip/split again
