## Site's purpose - key project goals, target audience
This site was developed in order to help a pair/ group of people split a bill after a tip was added to the total amount.
Although most people do know the fundamentals of mathmatics, few can calculate percentages, with or without the use of a calculator.
Tipping culture is a world wide phenomenon in which it is customary for a dining party to add a certain amount on top of the bill to reward quality service.
This practice has become more common even in countries where minimal wage provides a good living standard, thus increasing the demand for a simple calculator that can split the bill after a certain tip was calculated into the total amount.
The target audience are those who live in areas where tipping is customary or is becoming increasingly so.
Using Tip Calculator after a few drinks at the pub with the collegues is a great example of how even those who are usually great at solving complex equations in their heads sometimes need a little help too.
